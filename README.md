# [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) for Windows

This is a fully-featured WireGuard client for Windows that uses [WireGuardNT](https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-nt/about/). It is the only official and recommended way of using WireGuard on Windows.

## Download &amp; Install

If you've come here looking to simply run WireGuard for Windows, [the main download page has links](https://www.wireguard.com/install/). There you will find two things:

- [The WireGuard Installer](https://download.wireguard.com/windows-client/wireguard-installer.exe) &ndash; This selects the most recent version for your architecture, downloads it, checks signatures and hashes, and installs it.
- [Standalone MSIs](https://download.wireguard.com/windows-client/) &ndash; These are for system admins who wish to deploy the MSIs directly. For most end users, the ordinary installer takes care of downloading these automatically.

## Documentation

In addition to this [`README.md`](README.md), the following documents are also available:

- [`adminregistry.md`](docs/adminregistry.md) &ndash; A list of registry keys settable by the system administrator for changing the behavior of the application.
- [`attacksurface.md`](docs/attacksurface.md) &ndash; A discussion of the various components from a security perspective, so that future auditors of this code have a head start in assessing its security design.
